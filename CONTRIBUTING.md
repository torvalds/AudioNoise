# Contributing to AudioNoise

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AudioNoise! This project is a learning-focused digital audio effects toolkit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- ffmpeg (for audio format conversion)
- aplay (Linux audio playback) or equivalent
- Python 3 with numpy and matplotlib (for visualizer)

### Building

```bash
make convert
```

### Testing an Effect

```bash
make flanger   # or echo, phaser, fm, discont
```

This will:
1. Convert `BassForLinus.mp3` to raw format
2. Process it through the selected effect
3. Play the result
4. Save an MP3 of the output

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Open an issue with:
- Description of the bug
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, compiler version)

### Suggesting Features

Open an issue describing:
- What problem the feature solves
- Proposed implementation approach
- Any DSP references or algorithms involved

### Submitting Code

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-effect
   ```
3. **Make your changes** following the code style below
4. **Test thoroughly** with the provided Makefile targets
5. **Commit with clear messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add reverb effect using Schroeder algorithm"
   ```
6. **Push and open a Pull Request**

## Code Style

This project uses a minimal, kernel-like C style:

- **Indentation**: Tabs
- **Line length**: Keep reasonable (no hard limit, but ~80 chars preferred)
- **Braces**: K&R style (opening brace on same line)
- **Comments**: Use `//` for inline, `/* */` for block
- **Naming**: lowercase_with_underscores for functions/variables

### Adding a New Effect

1. Create `myeffect.h` with:
   ```c
   static inline void myeffect_init(float pot1, float pot2, float pot3, float pot4)
   {
       // Initialize effect state
       fprintf(stderr, "myeffect: param1=%g\n", pot1);
   }

   static inline float myeffect_step(float in)
   {
       // Process one sample
       return in;  // Modified output
   }
   ```

2. Add to `convert.c`:
   ```c
   #include "myeffect.h"
   // ...
   EFF(myeffect),  // in effects[] array
   ```

3. Add to `Makefile`:
   ```makefile
   effects = ... myeffect
   myeffect_defaults = 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5
   HEADERS = ... myeffect.h ...
   ```

### Design Principles

- **Zero latency**: Single sample in, single sample out
- **No FFT**: IIR filters and delay lines only
- **Hardware-friendly**: Code should be portable to embedded (RP2354)
- **Simple math**: Prefer fast approximations over library calls
- **Four pots**: All effects controlled by four float parameters (0.0-1.0)
